## About the project
The idea of the project is to be a board game enthusiasts hub. This is a web app where you can browse board games, create them, add them to your personal collection and comment something about them.

The users have personal profile pages where then can store their favorite games. They can edit and delete the games they created.

The app have register/login/profile pages to handle the users. The app also have catalog and gallery with slightly different functionality where you can browse and comment the games, look at their details, sort and search.

The app also have about and contact pages.

## Development server
Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The project uses Firebase Backend and Database for users, boardgames, comments and contact forms.

The project uses MUI material library for styling.
The project is using Formik library for form handling.

You will need the apiKey in the environment.ts file to access the Firebase functionality.

The application is currently hosted with Firebase on this address - `https://boardgamehub-4a607.web.app/`, but not the final version.
